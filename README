What is this
------------

This is a repository that contains [my up-to-date CV](http://wzpan.github.io/CV).

Building
--------

The CV is optimized to be built into a PDF using pdflatex.

In order to achieve this, you need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (TeXLive recommended);
   * XeTeX;
   * MinionPro and MyriadPro fonts (you can find them at *fonts* folder).

To build the PDF CVs, type `make`.
